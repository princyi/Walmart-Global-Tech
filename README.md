Walmart USA Advanced Software Engineering Interview Tip
Interview tip
In every interview, you will likely be asked, “Why do you want to work here?” and “Why this role?” Use these interview tips to craft the perfect answer to these common questions.
## “Why are you interested in this role?”
I recently participated in Walmart’s job simulation on Forage and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate in a software engineering team there.

During the simulation I gained experience and expertise implementing a novel version of a heap data structure, designing a UML class diagram for a data processor and creating a database that met a diverse range of requirements. It was fantastic to experience how working as a software engineer at Walmart touches and supports various different teams like the shipping department and the pet department.

Through this experience I validated that I really enjoy working on complex data-related challenges and working on projects that have real-world impact at a massive scale. I’d love to apply what I learned in a software engineering team at Walmart.
